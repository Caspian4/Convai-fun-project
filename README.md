# Public Speaking Helper Coach

The **Public Speaking Helper Coach** is an innovative project that transforms **ConvAI**, a platform originally designed for game NPCs, into a tool for personal development. This no-code project integrates **ChatGPT** and **Unity** to create a customizable AI coach for improving communication skills and confidence in speaking.

## 🎯 **Project Highlights**
- **Repurposing Game AI**: While ConvAI is widely used for game NPCs, this project demonstrates its potential for interactive and real-world applications, like public speaking practice.
- **Interactive Learning**: Practice introductions, interviews, and public speaking with constructive guidance from the AI coach.
- **Immersive 3D Environment**: A Unity-integrated 3D character makes interactions engaging and relatable.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- **ConvAI**: Provides conversational AI capabilities, powered by ChatGPT.
- **Unity**: Used to create and display the 3D character in an interactive interface.
- **ConvAI Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for integrating ConvAI with Unity, available [here](https://docs.convai.com).
